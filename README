# encoding_modulation_100_mbps_ethernet_network
complete program is in cpp
here 100base_fx singnal is being implemented
encoding shcemes:
                 4B5B 
                 NRZ-I
4B5B block encoding is used to avoid the synchronization problem of NRZ-I.
after 3 sequence of '0' or '1' bit,NRZ-I looses its synchronizaton.
Modulation technique:Binary phase shift keying or Biphase modulation is used.
